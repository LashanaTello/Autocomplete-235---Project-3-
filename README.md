# Project 3: Autocomplete
## CSCI 235

### Description
This program "autocompletes" a user-given word fragment and the number of word suggestions output to the user depends on the number of suggestions the user requested. For example, the program will ask for a word fragment, such as "str". It will then ask how many suggestions the user wants and the user may enter "7". The program will then output seven words or less (if it can not find seven words close to the word fragment). The list of words this program uses is called "words.txt" in this repository and it contains over 235,000 words.

### How To Use
Download the zip file for this repository. Open a terminal and go to the directory containing all the project files in this zip. Type "make all" to compile the project. Type "./Autocomplete" to run the project. The program will then ask the user for the text file containing a list of all words that will be used as a dictionary. Type "words.txt". Enter a word fragment and then enter a number of suggestions.
